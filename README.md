# BlueAllianceCLI
##ITS A WIP

To be used for scouting in FRC.
Currently planning on creating it as a CLI tool. 
Utilities:
- Get a team's history
- Compare your alliance vs enemy alliance (Score average, RP average, etc.)
- Get a team's stats (Score, RP, experience, etc.)

Set Up:
Create a .env file in the main directory
Place your APIKEY in there as a variable named API_BLUE
(When setting the key variable, don't use quotation marks around the apikey)

How to Use:
I will add instructions here later for the commands but you can use `-h`

To install Python libraries, run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Ugh... I'm gonna be so free on February 14th....anynyan~!
